# FacePost - A practice project
This is a practice project i made to learn Firebase and Xamarin Android on my 4th semester at Interaction Design - Aalborg University.
I followed a course on Udemy by Uchenna Nnodim, which can be found here: https://www.udemy.com/course/xamarin-android-app-with-cshap/?couponCode=CP130525


I used this project to enhance my competencies in order to create a travel app for Android as part of my semester project for that year, which can be seen in my repository named [Travia](https://pages.github.com/).
